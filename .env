# Specifies how spending approvals are made. Three modes are available:
#
# * `manual` means the lottery client will request two separate transactions, one to approve the
#   spending and one for the contract interaction;
# * `eip2612` means the lottery client will first ask for an EIP-2612 signature (with no gas cost)
#   and then perform the actual contract interaction;
# * `dai` means the lottery client will use the non-compliant signature system similar to EIP-2612
#   implemented in the Dai stablecoin (Dai signatures are slightly different from EIP-2612).
