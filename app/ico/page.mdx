# ExaLotto ICO

## Sale

We are now raising money to fund ExaLotto's jackpot and DAO!

<ICOForm />

## Overview

ExaLotto is a global, decentralized, trustless, autonomous, and provably fair lottery game. It's
based on the [Ethereum blockchain][ethereum].

No actor or institution can ever stop ExaLotto from running, manipulate it by biasing the game
results, or steal prize money in any way. The entire process of drawing the numbers as well as the
collection, custody, and distribution of prizes is implemented through smartcontracts published on
Ethereum.

To win the game a player must predict at least 2 of the 6 numbers that will be drawn every week.
Anyone can trigger the drawing process, and once triggered it will be carried out safely in a way
that cannot be tampered with or altered.

ExaLotto is the safest and most rewarding lottery ever created, and it will last forever. We dream
big: we want ExaLotto to be a _global_ lottery and have the largest jackpot ever!

## Key Highlights

- **Global**: users can play from any country in the world as long as they have access to an
  Ethereum wallet.
- **Decentralized**: 100% of the code runs on Ethereum smartcontracts. In principle, the game can be
  played using [etherscan][exalotto-etherscan] alone.
- **Autonomous**: anyone can join the DAO by buying the EXL token, voting proposals on
  [our Tally page][exalotto-tally], and driving the future of ExaLotto.
- **Provably Fair**: random numbers are generated with a proof of randomness and can’t be altered or
  biased. We use the [ChainLink VRF][chainlink-vrf] for that purpose.
- **Eternal**: it can never be stopped, anybody in the world can trigger the weekly drawing.

## ICO Allocation

We plan to use 50% of the raised funds to fund the jackpot and 50% to provide liquidity to whomever
may want to trade `EXL` on Uniswap. In the following chart, "LP" means "liquidity pool" and refers
to the Uniswap V3 position we'll open at ICO closure.

## Tokenomics

ExaLotto has an ERC-20 token (trading symbol `EXL`, find it [here on Etherscan][exl-etherscan])
providing its holders with a two-fold benefit:

- Participation in the governance through voting on Tally.
- Receive a 10% reward of all future revenues generated by ticket sales. Rewards are in ETH and are
  distributed proportionally to all `EXL` holders every week after the draw.

The total supply of EXL is limited to 1,000,000,000 tokens (with 18 decimals) and will be
distributed as follows:

We plan to make the EXL token deflationary by implementing a **buyback & burn program** soon after
the ICO. We plan to allocate 2% of the revenue to the program, using it every week after the draw to
buy `EXL` and burn it.

This will support the token price in the long term and provide constant liquidity for token holders.

The program will stop when 50% of the total supply is burned.

## FAQ

### 1. Who can access the ExaLotto ICO?

Anyone with ETH can buy EXL. In fact, due to the nature of the Ethereum blockchain, it is not
possible to restrict the sale of EXL to specific countries. However, if you are a resident of the
United States of America (including its territories), Canada, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,
Cuba, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Crimea, People’s Republic of China, Bahamas, Belarus, Botswana, Burundi,
Cambodia, Central African Republic, The Democratic Republic of Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, Ethiopia,
Ghana, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama,
Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia,
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Yemen, and Zimbabwe, we recommend **not** participating in the
ICO.

### 2. What is the lock-up schedule of the tokens sold in the ICO?

EXL tokens sold during the ICO are subject to the following lock-up: 100% of the tokens bought will
unlock when the ICO ends. At that point you'll be able to redeem you tokens by hitting the _"Redeem
EXL"_ button on this page or the soon-to-be [Partners page][partners].

### 3. How do I fund my purchase?

You can buy EXL using ETH. Please find the [sale panel][sale-panel] at the top of this page.

### 4. How does the sale work?

Enter the amount to buy in the [sale panel][sale-panel] and click _"Buy EXL"_. This will start a
transaction with our [ICO smartcontract][ico-etherscan] (your wallet will ask confirmation before
proceeding).

The smartcontract will act as an escrow and keep both the ETH you sent and the EXL you
bought, keeping track of your EXL balance in its internal state. You can buy multiple times and all
your tokens will add up in your balance. We provide 20% of the total supply for sale and that's the
only limit to how much EXL you can buy.

When we close the ICO the smartcontract will automatically distribute the accumulated ETH to the
lottery and other addresses as described [above][ico-allocation], and allow you to redeem your EXL.
Clicking the _"Redeem EXL"_ button will transfer your EXL balance to your wallet, at which point
you'll be able to [trade EXL on Uniswap][exl-uniswap].

However, we recommend hodling your tokens for the reasons below. :)

### 5. What can I do with EXL tokens?

`EXL` is an ERC-20 token providing great benefits:

1. Every week you'll get a share of the earnings from the ticket sales proportional to the EXL
   share you own (yes, it's passive income!)
1. If you own more than 1% of EXL's total supply you'll be able to create proposals in our DAO,
   [managed on Tally][exalotto-tally].
1. We plan to implement a buyback-and-burn program in the near future, so we expect EXL's value to
   grow in the long term.
