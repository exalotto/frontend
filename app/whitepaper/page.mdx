# ExaLotto Whitepaper

## Abstract

We hereby provide the design specification of **ExaLotto**, a lottery game based on the Ethereum
Virtual Machine (“EVM” in the following).

The game will be managed as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (“DAO” in the following).

## Motivations

Lottery games have ancient origins tracing back to the Chinese Han Dynasty, between years 205 and
187 BC. The core idea of the game is that every player pays a small amount of money and a randomly
chosen lucky winner gets the money from all contributions.

Unfortunately, classic operation of such games requires a central running authority and subjects
them to several issues:

- **Censorship**: some countries make some or all lotteries illegal.
- **Locality**: lotteries are usually State-managed and subject to local regulations, making them
  impossible to extend across borders and turn global.
- **Obscure or unfair prize allocation**: in a typical lottery game a share of the jackpot is
  attributed to every winning category, but the way these shares are allocated is almost never
  explained and is often unfair.
- **Outright scams**: classic operation provides little to no guarantees about the fairness of the
  drawing process, as well as the actual value of the ticket sales. The drawn numbers may be biased
  to favor specific players, and / or the lottery operator may advertise a jackpot that is
  significantly lower (but still attractive enough) than the ticket sales. It is certainly
  suspicious that many lotteries constantly advertise perfectly round-numbered jackpots like $1M.

Case in point, [Hot Lotto][hot-lotto] has suffered one of the most famous lottery fraud scandals
(not necessarily the worst). Other known frauds include a [Serbian lottery announcing the numbers
before they were drawn][serbian-lottery] and [Chinese lottery operators reportedly stealing jackpot
money][chinese-lottery]. Other frauds that may have occurred might never be uncovered.

We want to overcome all the above problems by implementing a new lottery game based on a
decentralized, trustless, censorship-resistant, and cryptographically verified platform: the EVM.
