# How to Play

NOTE: in this article we provide specific instructions on how to play using
[MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), but ExaLotto supports other popular connection methods via
[WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.com/).

## Introduction

ExaLotto is a global, autonomous, decentralized, and most importantly **provably fair** lottery.

It's mathematically impossible for anyone to steal the prize money or bias the numbers to favor
specific players. Furthermore there is no central operating authority:
[anyone can trigger ExaLotto's weekly draw](/draw)!

This page shows how to play the fairest, safest lottery game in the world!

## 1. Install and Connect MetaMask

You can skip this step if you already have an Ethereum wallet.

Head on to [metamask.io](https://metamask.io/) and download the extension for your browser.

Once installed, MetaMask will guide you through the creation of a new wallet and provide an option
to buy your first ethers.

## 2. Connect MetaMask

Now you can click the "Connect Wallet" button at the top-right corner of the website to connect
MetaMask to ExaLotto:

This will allow ExaLotto to buy your lottery tickets using MetaMask (confirmations will be asked
first).

## 3. Select Your Numbers

You can select the numbers you want to play on most pages in this site:

![Picker numbers](/images/picker_numbers.png)

You need to select at least 6 numbers and at most 20. The price of your ticket will increase based
on how many numbers you're playing. A ticket with 6 numbers has a base price of $1.50, and the price
of other tickets is multiplied by every possible 6-number combination you're playing.

After selecting your lucky numbers, hit the "Play" button!

## 4. Confirm Transaction

MetaMask will show a pop-up window containing various details about the transaction, including the
price of your ticket as well as an estimate of the gas fee you'll pay.

A ticket with 10 numbers (which is $315.00) may look like this:

After confirming the transaction in MetaMask a confirmation dialog containing the transaction ID
will show up on the website:

You can view your transaction in [Polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com/):

## 5. Wait for the Next Drawing

Head on to the ["Home"](/) page. The jackpot and the "draw" tiles at the bottom are updated in real
time. We draw new numbers on Saturday evening every week, and if we haven't drawn yet
[you might as well just do it yourself](/draw)!

If luck is on your side and you matched at least 2 of the drawn numbers you'll see something like
this:

If you know you have played a ticket that matches 2 or more numbers but your win is not showing up,
please make sure the website is connected to your wallet (refresh the page and click the "Connect
Wallet" button in the top-right corner) and that you are connected to the correct network,
**Polygon PoS (chain ID 137)**.

## 6. Cash Out!

Have you won? That's great! Visit [exalotto.eth](https://exalotto.eth.limo/) at any time, connect
your wallet, click the tile of your lucky draw, and withdraw your prize by clicking the "Withdraw"
button!

There is no deadline, the smartcontract will keep all your prizes indefinitely until you withdraw
them.
